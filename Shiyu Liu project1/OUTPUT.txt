The main method of my algorithm is in ICtest.java. It takes the first string in the command line
as the route of the input file and takes the second string in the command line as the route 
of the output file. So please type in the location of the input file on your computer in the 
first command line and then specify the location where you want to find your output file.
For eclipse, you can type the locations in program arguments under argument under run 
configurations. Ex: \Users\liusy\Desktop\extra_test.txt

To run InfixCalculator, you have to create a new InfixCalculator object. First, you have to call
InfixToPostifx() which takes strings as arguments. Then, you have to print out the result returned
by calling calculator() which has an empty parameter.
